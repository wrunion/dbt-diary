They also have three cups in front of them, but don't seem to choose any of the options.) \n\nIt's interesting bc the 4 of cups is often a \"refusal\" card, and seeing as someone being a stick-in-the-mud and refusing to join in the fun. But it could just as easily be a *discernment* card. \n\nReaching out and taking a cup from an unknown source (especially a random floating hand) isn't actually a great idea, and it strikes me that sometimes what we see as being \"jaded\" is actually, in reality, just being smart. \n\nThat being said, I think this card for me today is an invitation to look over the options in front of me with a more generous eye, and look for the good along with the bad before I make any hard and fast decisions. I can be too easy to reject things wholesale without appreciating them or trying first. (But I can also be too gullible, and end up drinking poisoned water without realizing it.) \n\nI'm really kind of traumatized from everything I went through this year, with MAC and AEMP, and I think it's made me closed off to new possibilities. And that's valid and real, but also a shame. So maybe it's a good day to try to look for what makes the world worth it, again.\n\nReversals and all cards were enabled",

In the past, I think he's been a warning card, especially when it was time for me to slow down and rest; today he may be an icon or inspiration - to keep forging ahead and leaning into the strength and creative energy I'm growing into (while also taking enough time to rest and do self-care.) \n\nI need to remember that when I'm feeling reasonably well physically and mentally, like I am right now, I achieved that state through a LOT of hard work. Staying healthy is a delicate balance that I have to continually find, and fight for. It's not something passive - it's something I have to work hard to maintain.

I feel like I don't have the skills to do DBT, which I know is silly since DBT is all about building skills. I always feel like I'm doing it wrong though, which is at least partially bc large chunks of DBT are designed for ppl with opposite problems to mine - ppl who struggle with too little empathy, instead of too much.\n\nI really struggle with asserting myself, and standing up for myself and articulating my own needs. I *don't* at all struggle with seeing where the other person is coming from, or seeing their wants/needs. I see it so clearly it blots out all else, and leaves me unable to see or feel what I myself need to be seeing and feeling. \n\nSo when it comes to GIVE skills and a focus on empathy, it's really the opposite of what I need. I am trying though, for the sake of the program. I don't want Susan to think I'm not trying, and to stop giving me second chances to make it through the program. (Which, as I write that, I know is silly, since I'm pretty sure, objectively, everything is fine, and she probably don't have any negative thoughts/concerns about me as a patient. It's something that's hard to get away from, though.) ",

Perhaps you are not clear on your desired outcome so your efforts are misdirected or unfocused. Maybe you have lost touch with your ‘why’, or it wasn’t compelling enough, and now you’re lacking motivation in completing the goal.
