      "experiences": "A lot of anxiety every time I thought about using these skills at home. I also experienced anxiety trying to learn about them, since it is kind of new to me, and I feel like the DBT material I have hasn't given me very much at all to go on. I just feel kind of lost, honestly. And I feel like these skills are meant for something like a business interaction, not a relationship. Honestly, if you have to apply these skills to your partnership, something is going VERY wrong in the first place. Like, if clearly communicating your needs isn't enough to get them met (or, for your partner to say they can't do that, which is valid) then like... I don't know how anything else would work. That's the core thing about relationships - your partner actually giving a damn about your needs - so like. If they're not willing to put in that basic, bare minimum of effort, no amount of \"skills\" are going to change that - at least in a lasting, healthy way that isn't likely to bring about resentment in the long run, from a partner who feels like they were strong-armed into agreeing to something they later regret. It honestly just seems like, in a healthy relationship, you'd only be using these to overcome existing boundaries which just...doesn't sound good."
