It made my anxiety shoot through the roof, so I distracted with hyperfocus on notes. \n\nThe good thing is that I noticed and identified that it was anxiety/panic, and that it was too high to try to bring it down in the moment. And that I distracted instead. I would like to have a better way to self-soothe in future moments, though. \n\nI also keep having thoughts that are disturbing and that I can't seem to go away. Susan says that pushing thoughts away makes them more active, but I don't really know what the alternative is. \n\nPM 2: I have the usual pain in my neck and shoulders; hopefully it won't get any worse than that today. \n\nJoy 2: I'm tired, so not feeling super joyful, but I do feel focused and productive, so if I get some work done with Elle today I'll probably feel better. I'm also stressed out about the minutia of dealing with meds refills, and all the money that OTC meds cost, so that ups my stress levels and makes it hard. to stay in the moment, which is where I can find joy.

      "notes": "Time: 2:20 PM\n\nCalm: 4/5 I'm taking the morning to not work, and to just journal and read tarot and also read a DBT book from the library. Whenever I shut the door in my own room, and sit in my \"book nook\" and journal or make art, I feel calm and peaceful. \n\nJoy: 4/5 Journaling, reading, and resting bring me quiet joy\n\nRacing Thoughts: 3/5 My thoughts are going a million miles a minute this morning, but I found things to focus on (DBT book, tarot draw, journaling) and that's really helped. \n\nAs Scott and I always say, If you recognize the \"brain weasels\" (racing thoughts) and give them something to chew on, they'll leave you in peace :) \n\nIntentionality: 3/5 This season of my life is about stopping to REST before my brain and body just give out on me. In the last year alone I've had several mental health crisis, and one full on breakdown. It's definitely time to step back, rest, and reflect on what's been going right and wrong, so I can more mindfully choose the path ahead. \n\nPhys. mis: 3/5 Tightness between shoulder blades, neck and shouder/back pain, need to find a better way to sit\n\nEmo mis: 1/5 Lots of racing thoughts, but for the moment they're at bay. Mindfulness helps\n\nSkills score: 5/5 I've been using lots of them today! Taking time aside to breathe and journal and read has made all the difference.\n\nFatigue: 4/10\n\nI'm tired and fatigued today - I didn't get to sleep until 4 am (wasn't sleepy. I ate dinner late, though.)\n\nMorning mindfulness: I decided to do a tarot draw and journal for my morning mindfulness, which I'm defining as, \"Choose a single activity and focus only on that for at least 20 minutes. Single minded, even if there are multiple sensory inputs.\" \n\nI journaled about the cards \"Temperance,\" and the \"Knight of Wands.\" \n\nTarot Card: The Knight of Wands represents being passionate but potentially reckless, and charging ahead toward your goals. It's a necessary energy - you wouldn't get anywhere without passion and motivation - but it can also be destructive, if not tempered.\n\nTarot Card: Temperance. Temperance represents what I'm working toward in DBT: a self that is more present, mindful, and grounded. A self that takes time to pause and reflect on the moment before acting. A self who is wise and balanced between emotion and reason. \n\nTo me, Temperance also represents intentionality. Whereas the Knight is focused on the immediate future and the immediate desire or goal, I think Temperance takes a longer look at things, and prioritizes tasks as a whole before diving into any one particular thing. \n\nThe strength of the Knight is that they are immediate, and present, and fully immersed in what they are doing. Without that, Temperance would be lost in the land of map-making. But without Temperance's planning and vision, the Knight might unknowingly charge right off a cliff, with the best of intentions. \n\nSo, I think the Knight & Temperance have the potential to balance each other out really beautifully! \n\nI'm going to use that as a metaphor/theme for the next season of life, I think. It feels relevant to the ideas of Emotion, Logic, and Wise Mind that DBT talks about! \n\nNote to self: Research the Temperance card more, and compare the artwork in different decks. Create an altar space to her. ",

And normally, when I have a negative thought about one of those things, I immediately respond with a list of reasons of why I should be more grateful. Or I try to provide \"positive\" counter arguments. \n\nBut today I'm just letting the thoughts be what they are. If I'm upset or complaining about something in my head I just...let myself complain.

Normally, work stress - especially interpersonal friction - just shuts my brain down but I was able to step back and think through the situation, and then plan a productive approach to a hard conversation that I still need to have.",
      "homework": "This week's homework is to write out a DEAR MAN script for an interpersonal interaction. Here's my attempt to use it for my client meeting tomorrow, with a client who hasn't done their part in the project. \n\nPrompting event: the project is stalled. Each party has things they need to take responsibility for, and action on, before work can get done again. My objectives are to get both parties to divide work evenly, and to both have buy-in for their part of the work. \n\nI'm honestly too tired to care about the relationship atm; I just want to get the project done, and I'm willing to be a bit unlikeable to get that to happen. Self respect is important, but again, my primary goal here is just to do whatever I need to do to get the \"show on the road\" so to speak. \n\nI do recognize that I need to be relational and personable to be effective in this situation, so I will, but my goal isn't really the relationship itself - that ship has sort of sailed for me.\n\nDEAR MAN script: \n\n1. Describe situation: \"We all care about this project, and we all it to be successful. We all want to get resources to youth, and we all have a personal vested interest and passion in this area. We're coming up on roadblocks, but I think if we can clarify roles, and who's responsible for what, we can move forward successfully together.\"\n\n2. Express feelings/opinions: \"We've spent a lot of time putting together these resources for gathering data, and we think they should give you a solid start and foundation. I'd like to go over the material today, and answer any questions you can think of, and we'll be available for ongoing questions as well by Slack or email.\" \n\n3. Assert request directly: \"We can only build the application when we have a good amount (how much?) of data to work with. That may take (X) hours, and (describe data gathering process here.) I'd like to talk about the resources and schedule you're planning to dedicate, so we can figure out on our end what our work schedule will be.\"\n\n4. Reinforce: \"We're also excited and eager to see this project come to fruition, and we've built a solid house for the data to live in. As soon as we can get the data we need, we can build out the rest of the application, then do beta testing, then get this out to the people who need it!\" \n\n5. Mindful - Just keep referring back to the goal of getting the project done, and getting resources into the hands of youth. \n\n6. Negotiating - If/when issues come up, make it a values based instead of position based, and ask them for solutions. Turn the table if needed. \n\n\"We didn't plan to be the data experts on this; we agreed and expected to provide guidance on data shape. If more help is still needed, what do you suggest we should do?\" \n\n7. Validating - ask for their struggles, listen and reflect back. Validate their need to get this done. \n\n8. Easy manner - maintain spirit of camaraderie.",

      "homework": "DEAR MAN Homework for DBT Providence group today:\n\nSituation: SR being late all the time and spotty and inconsistent with communication\n\nPrompting event for my problem: Who did what to whom? What led up to what? \nStreet Roots has consistently cancelled meetings with little or no notice, and has blocked out communication for months at a time. Last year, we went a full 6 months without being able to talk to them in person, all while we were under a strict deadline so that the site didn’t break.\n\nAs a result, we had to make decisions on our own, and dedicate our own time to making sure the site didn’t break. It was very frustrating and felt very unfair. It’s also hard to work in such a way.\n\nObjectives in Situation (What results I want): \nStreet Roots to show up on time, and communicate in a timely manner. Also, an agreement that whatever we agree on in the meetings actually happens. We can’t help fix what we don’t know about. \n\nRelationship Issue (How I want the other person to feel about me): \nI want the relationship to be a strong, mutually respectful working relationship. I want us to be able to communicate clearly and efficiently. I want us to like each other and work well together.\n\nSelf-Respect Issue (How I want to feel about myself):\nI refuse to work with someone who treats me like this, frankly. For my self respect, the other person either needs to change their behavior, or I need to set a boundary about working with them. (Maybe I should talk to Andrew?) \n\nDescribe situation: There is a communication breakdown right now between our two organizations. Last year, many times we were asked for urgent requests, and then ignored when we fulfilled them. We also had to wait 6 months to get any face time with Sophie and Kaia, despite repeatedly asking, and repeatedly scheduling meetings.\n\nThose meetings were usually scheduled a month out, because we were told there was no sooner time available, but when the time for the meeting came, it was usually cancelled with less than 24 hours notice, and no explanation or apology. \n\nThis happened twice in a row, and both were instances we had critical questions that remained unanswered. Our work was much less efficient because of it.\n\nWhen we did finally connect with Kaia and Sophie, in December 2020, we learned things that would have greatly benefitted us to know 6 months earlier than that. Again, the project suffered. \n\nAdditionally, we have been asked for urgent work on short notice, and complied because we felt it was the moral thing to do (specific wildfire example), only to have all communication from Street Roots cease for weeks. By the time our emails were responded to, the 40+ hours of emergency work we had put in were no longer relevant or needed, meaning that all that (free, urgent weekend) labor had gone to waste. \n\nExpress feelings: It’s very frustrating, as a professional, to be treated this way. We’re doing this primarily for free - even the grants we get cover at best half of the hours we work, and usually more like a third. So we’re volunteering the majority of our time.\n\nI’m happy to volunteer that time - I do it because I care. However, I’d like to be treated with basic rules of respect. I need clear and timely communication, and I need as much notice as possible if a meeting needs to be cancelled. \n\nAssert: Also, I would like to agree that if someone cancels a set meeting, it’s their responsibility to find a time to reschedule with everyone, and set and host that meeting. \n\nReinforce: Getting on the same page about how we communicate will be good for the project and for the community it benefits. It will also help all of us work as effectively as possible, and it will help us save a LOT of development time, which makes it possible to create more features for the same amount of money. ",
