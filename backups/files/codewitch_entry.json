The meaning I looked up was \"cutting to the heart of the matter\")\n- The Wheel (I don't think I've ever pulled this card before. signifies major changes)\n\nFrom the Labyrynthos app explanation: \n- 10 of pent: \"Represents the culmination of life's journeys. There's a sense of fulfillment that usually results from hard work in all of life's facets.\"\n- ace of swords: victor, raw strength, sharp mind\n- The Wheel: change, cycles, the way things must be",

    "tarot": "Recently I drew the Knight of Wands (fire, passion, forward motion) along with Temperance. \n\nTemperance is all about balance - having one foot in the flow, and one foot on the solid ground. The card represents planning for a stable, long term future, which I really want. \n\nAt the same time, the Knight represents the fierce energy to keep moving forward, along with ambition and creative drive (my own interpretation, but also based on the Biddy Tarot card description.) \n\nOn the less-positive side of things, the Knight of Wands can represent impulsivity, poor decision making, and being essentially a fool who rushes in. \n\nBoth these cards have showed up in multiple readings lately, and they're something to pay attention to. They speak of the balance I want to acheive. ",
